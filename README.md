Number Guessing Game :

This is my first Python project â€” a simple Number Guessing Game.

## ðŸ“Œ How it Works
- The program randomly selects a number.
- The player tries to guess the number.
- The program tells if the guess is too high or too low until the player guesses correctly.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py
